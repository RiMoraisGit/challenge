Solution for Xpand IT Backend Challenge

Notes:
- I usually use Lombock for the following annotations—@Getter, @Setter, @AllArgsConstructor, and @NoArgsConstructor—but because it requires different setups depending on the IDE, I just chose to do all getters, setters, and constructors manually.

Project:
- Maven
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.1 with the following dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA and H2 Database.

Run Application:
- Just run as Spring Boot Application the "ChallengeApplication.java" file.
